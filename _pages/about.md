Welcome to my website!

My research investigates how the mechanisms that underpin action production and perception also support human cooperation. I aim to study human cooperation in a broad sense (see below for more) and using a number of approaches (shameless reference to interdisciplinarity incoming), drawing on conceptual and methodological tools from psychology, behavioral economics, philosophy, machine learning and robotics.

**Action coordination:**
I study how the production and perception of actions help us coordinate -  who would have guessed it? From moving tables together to dancing tango, I investigate how coordinated social interactions are influenced by the various signals present in the instrumental and communicative movements of actors.


**Social decision-making:**
 Economic games can be an informative model of both small and large scale cooperation problems (if you can get participants to overcome the math anxiety induced by payoff matrices and calculations). I investigate how the mechanisms that allow us to understand the goals and intentions behind an action allow us to make inferences that guide our decisions in economic interactions such as social dilemmas or collective foraging.

**Culture:**
Until Elon Musk figures out how to upload our consciousness to GitHub, acting upon the environment will continue to be central to our cultural practices. Thus, I investigate how the features of our actions influence social learning, shape and are shaped by our social norms, and may constrain how our cultural practices evolve.

**Human-robot interaction:**
One of the big challenges for HRI is to make interactions smooth. If you think conference dinners are awkward, youâ€™ve never grabbed a glass handed to you by a robotic arm. I apply our understanding of action coordination and cooperation to make robots more ergonomic.
